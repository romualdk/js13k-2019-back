| I. INTRODUCTION                                                       [SEC1]|

A. FOREWORD                                                             [FRWD]

I feel that I should mention that I am by no means the best person to write 
such a document; the extent of my programming abilities are basic HTML and an 
extremely rudimentary grasp of hexadecimal. But I'm the one that actually got 
around to writing this, so I guess you're stuck with me, eh? In any event 
though, I've applied myself to doing the best job I can in conveying this 
information.

The overall tone of this FAQ is meant to be accessible to someone who is not 
familiar with hex editing or any sort of computer programming. First and 
foremost, I seek to convey mechanics that would be of interest and practical 
use to a player - though I may add information on aspects not related to 
gameplay as such information becomes known to me. This document is written 
primarily with the NES version in mind, but is also largely applicable to the
PSX version. I may create a version of this for Origins specifically in the
future. Particularly in the earlier versions, the organization might not be
ideal (and may indeed change later),and there may be some incomplete
information about the more obscure mechanics of the game. I'm trying to cover
the basics at the very least, though, and provide some potentially useful
charts. If you know of any information that is not included here, and
_especially_ if you see any errors, please contact me.


You can reach me at pravoka[AT]hotmail[DOT]com



B. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                                     [ACKN]

This is the part of the FAQ where I have to extend credit and my gratitude to
more people than I can properly quantify. While I compiled many of the charts
in this document and did (mostly) original research in making them, most of the
base knowledge of mechanics must be attributed to other sources. I would be
remiss if I did not begin with the triad of Alex Jackson, anomie, and Paulygon
who have done so much to reveal the inner workings of the game, and all of whom
I've had at least some opportunity to interact with in learning about how this
game works - particularly Paulygon in my first year of learning, and anomie in
the last year or two. Grond has also lent a hand in increasing my
understanding, and silktail has always been quick to answer questions covering
a number of topics.

Thanks also go to patbuns/sqpat for the Character Lists FAQ, and to BSiron's
FAQ - while they have become somewhat outdated over the years, together they
have been a great resource for FF1 players seeking to understand the game, and
a resource for a couple things in this document. To a similar end, great thanks
are due to Disch, the creator of FFHackster. This program has given me access
to an astounding amount of raw data in the game, and is an indispensable
resource.

And finally, I wish to extend my thanks to the Final Fantasy NES board, the
community of which has been one of the most welcoming and interesting boards on
GFAQs, to the point where it led me to hang out here more and sparked an
interest in learning more about the progenitor of the Final Fantasy series.

I have attempted to properly credit the sources of my information in the
credits section. Unfortunately, in many cases I cannot separate out who
discovered what (and often who taught me what), so I am collectively crediting
the individuals responsible (to my knowledge) for mechanics/formula sections.
If you are responsible for any of the discoveries in this document but are not
mentioned in the acknowledgments or credits or know anyone who is, please let
me know and I will add mention of you!



C. LEGAL STUFF                                                          [LEGL]

This document is copyright 2009-2012 by Jeanne Mevnais. As of now, only
Gamefaqs has permission to post this document. This document may not be
reproduced under any circumstances, with the exception that individuals may
reproduce it in unchanged form for personal, private use. It may not be placed
on any website or otherwise distributed publicly without advance written
permission. If for some odd reason you want to post this document elsewhere,
contact me and I'll consider it (although until the document is more or less
finalized, I want the only version to remain where I can easily update it. Yes,
I am aware that it has been three years since I first posted it. I'm working
slowly!). If you see it elsewhere, please inform me about it. Generally, just
use this for your own benefit and give credit where credit is due. Sound good?



D. VERSION HISTORY                                                      [HIST]

0.85 (7/3/12) - Realized it's been three years - far too long. Removed tabs so
the document will display properly in all browsers, and corrected many errors.
Added quick look-up identifies throughout the document. Still a lot to do, but
at least many errors have been corrected.

0.80 (7/3/09) - Finally got enough time together to get a tentative version of
this to be available until I have the time and acquire the information to
properly complete it. Submitted it and hoped for the best.

0.11-0.50 (2008) - Made various charts and such. Posted the FF Formulas thread
(now sticky) on 3/1/2008, which was the first readily accessible source for
much of the information that would form the basis of this document. Dallied
about a lot with school and never got around to finishing this.

0.01 (7/14/07) - Made the Weapon Critical Tables because I thought it might be
interesting.

0.10 (?/??/07) - Decided to go ahead and actually make a mechanics FAQ. I made
the word document to do it on and formatted it and stuff!


E. TO-DO LIST                                                           [TODO]

*Add Bugged Status Element in Elements section
*Add in enemy locations and formations
*Complete formation list
*Get Random Number List
*Add in hex offset references
*Include Key Item Information
*Include Treasure Data, Explain Duplicate Chests
*Incorporate Ship Game
*Incorporate Respond Rate, figure out delay rates
*Include music data?
*Include graphic data?
*Develop a better layout (make subpoints stand out more)
*Clean stuff up and correct any mistakes identified
*Other stuff I've no doubt forgotten

| II. TERMS, ELEMENTS, & STATUSES                                       [SEC2]|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. TERMINOLOGY                                                          [TERM]

A...B = Random number from A to B inclusive that division rounds down unless 
        otherwise specified.
R = Random Number
PC = Player Character (one of the four Light Warriors)
Enchanted Item = A Weapon or Armor that casts a magic spell when used as an 
                 item in battle.

FI = Fighter
KN = Knight
TH = Thief
NI = Ninja
BB = Black Belt
MA = Master
RM = Red Mage
RW = Red Wizard
WM = White Mage
WW = White Wizard
BM = Black Mage
BW = Black Wizard



B. STATS                                                                [STAT]

1. Character Stats

LV  = Level. Stats increase on level up, and it is used for some BB/MA formulas
EXP.= Experience Points. Gain these for level-ups.
HP  = Hit Points. Your character's health.
MP  = Magic Points ("Spell Charges"). The amount of times you can use a given 
      spell level.
STR = Strength. Increases Attack Power by [STR/2].
AGL = Agility. Increases Evasion by [AGI].
INT = Intelligence. SHOULD probably increase Magic Accuracy, but does nothing.
VIT = Vitality. Increases HP gained upon level-up by [VIT/4].
LCK = Luck. Increases chance to run (but has little influence due to a bug)
ATK = Attack (the game calls this stat "Damage," but this guide will refer to
      it as "Attack" for clarity)
DEF = Defense (the game class this stat "Absorb," but this guide will refer to
      it as "Defense" for clarity)
HIT%= Hit %. Increases Accuracy, and increases Number of Hits by [Hit%/32]
EVA%= Evade %. Chance to avoid attacks.
MD  = Magic Defense. Chance to avoid magic attacks. This stat is hidden.


2. Equipment/Spell Stats

WATK = Weapon Attack. This increases your Attack Power.
CRIT = Critical Rate. This determines your chance of a Critical Hit.
TYPE = Enemy Family Type. Hurt category for weapons on specific enemies.
DEF  = Defense. This is the Defense boost from a piece of armor.
WGT  = Weight. This is the Evasion penalty from armor.
E    = Effectivity. This determines the damage a spell does, or its effect.
SA   = Spell Accuracy. This increases a spell's chance to hit.
ELEM = Element. The elemental affinity for Weapon/Armor/Magic.



C. ELEMENTS                                                             [ELEM]

There are eight elements of this game. While not referred to specifically by
name in the NES version, they each represent a general theme, and indeed have
been identified in subsequent version of the game. The element names that I'll
be using, combined with the identifying hexadecimal value, are:

01 - Status                     10 - Fire
02 - Poison/Stone               20 - Ice
04 - Time                       40 - Lightning
08 - Death                      80 - Earth

Elemental affinities can apply to Weapons, Armor, Magic, Enemy Resistance and
Weakness, and Enemy Status Attacks. The combination of Poison and Stone attacks
into a single element is somewhat curious; I suspect that they were combined
due to lack of a ninth element, though why these particular elements were tied
together is beyond me.

Elements are relevant in that they affect the Power and Accuracy of attacks,
both physical and magical. They have the ability to increase Attack and Chance
to Hit of Weapons (though this is bugged and doesn't work on the NES), and may
increase OR decrease the Effectivity and Chance to Hit for Magic (and, for some
spells, prevent functioning altogether). For example, attacking a ZOMBIE with
the Flame Sword (should) give you +4 Attack and increase Chance to Hit by 40,
and getting hit with RUB while wearing a Pro Ring will reduce its Base Chance
to Hit to 0. If something is non-elemental, it just behaves as normal without
any bonuses or penalties.

Also, according to anomie, "There's also a bug in the player's elemental
weaknesses, the player is "weak" against any element their weapon is strong
against. Fortunately, the bug that prevents the weapon elemental strengths from
ever being loaded makes this bug never do anything."

D. STATUSES                                                             [STUS]

Like elements, there are eight statuses in this game:

01 - Dead                       10 - Paralyzed
02 - Petrified                  20 - Asleep
04 - Poisoned                   40 - Silenced
08 - Blind                      80 - Confused

Party Formation will change when a character is dead, petrified, or poisoned at
the end of a battle (See: Party Reordering)

There are two additional "statuses" not covered by the status byte:

Regeneration - Character recovers 2HP per turn (bugged and does not work on the
               NES, recovers 5% MaxHP on FF: Origins). Only enemies can have
               this status, which is set when the "Enemy Type" byte is set to
               80 (Regenerative - see E. Enemy Types below).

Critical     - Character kneels down. This is triggered when a character's 
               current HP drops below MaxHP/4. Unlike subsequent games, this
               has no practical significance apart from being a visual cue.


1. Status Explanations

01 - Death

Explanation: This bit is set when a character dies, either from having HP
reduced to 0, or by having the status directly applied through a status attack
or a spell (which also sets HP to 0). A character cannot do anything, receive
any damage or healing, or receive any other statuses while in this state
(although, due to a quirk of programming, characters CAN recover from statuses
previously set in-battle while dead (e.g., Paralysis))

Inflicted By
       Spells: BANE, RUB, QAKE, XXXX, ZAP!
       Skills: CRACK, SQUINT, GLARE, TOXIC
       Status Attack: SORCERER

Cure: Using a Clinic or LIFE (Revive at 1HP), or LIF2 (Revive at Max HP)
NOTE: This status cannot be cured in-battle.


02 - Petrifaction

Explanation: While petrified, a character cannot do anything, receive damage or
healing, or receive any other statuses (however, characters will lose HP when
walking over Lava or Ice Damage Tiles). Unlike the Death status, HP is not set
to 0 when a character is petrified. Enemies however are removed from battle
when petrified, so it functions the same way as instant death against them.

Inflicted By
        Spells: BRAK
        Skills: GLANCE, POISON
        Status Attack: COCTRICE

Cure: SOFT [Potion], SOFT (Spell)
NOTE: Like Death, this status cannot be cured in-battle.


04 - Poison

Explanation: While poisoned, a character receives 2HP of damage at the end of
every round, and takes 1HP of damage for each step in the world map. Poison
will not reduce a character's HP below 1 outside of battle, but can kill a
character in-battle. Enemies cannot be poisoned (due to a bug?), though there
is no PC-accessible Spell to inflict it in any event.

Inflicted By
        Spells: None
        Skills: STINGER
        Status Attack: WrWOLF, ASP, SCORPION, LOBSTER, MEDUSA, CATMAN, PEDE, 
                       SCUM, SLIME, ARACHNID, WYVERN, OCHO, NAOCHO, NAGA,
                       GrNAGA, MudGOL

Cure: PURE [Potion], PURE (Spell)


08 - Blind

Explanation: While blind, a character's base chance to hit when attacking is
reduced by 40, and an enemy attacking that character's base chance to hit is
increased by 40. Note that this is different from decreasing Hit% or Evasion,
which are not statuses and instead act on a character's stats which plug into
the formula, rather than altering the formula directly.

To illustrate, if a character with 22 Evasion has a spell cast on them to
reduce Evasion by 40 (ignoring the fact that no such spell exists), they have
their Evasion reduced by 40. Since a stat cannot be negative, Evasion would
equal 0. This works out to a reduction of 22 Evasion, resulting in a +22/201
(+~11%) increase in the enemy's overall chance to hit. However, if a character
with 22 Evasion is instead blinded, the enemy's _base_ chance to hit is
directly increased by 40, resulting instead in a +40/201 (+~20%) increase in
the enemy's overall chance to hit.

Inflicted By
        Spells: DARK, BLND
        Skills: FLASH, SNORTING, INK
        Status Attack: SHADOW

Cure: LAMP, Automatically at the end of battle.


10 - Paralysis

Explanation: While paralyzed, a character cannot do anything, but can receive 
damage and healing. When attacking a paralyzed target, the target's evade is
not factored in to chance to hit, and the attacker's Attack rating will be
multiplied by 5/4. A paralyzed character is still scheduled for a turn each
round, and on that turn will either continue to be "Paralyzed" or will be
"Cured!"

Inflicted By
        Spells: HOLD, STUN, STOP
        Skills: GAZE, TRANCE, DAZZLE
        Status Attack: CRAWL, IMAGE, WRAITH, GHOST, GEIST, SPECTER, PHANTOM, 	
                       GrMEDUSA, VAMPIRE, WzVAMP, Zombie D, GUARD, LICH(1),
                       LICH(2), CHAOS

Cure: PCs     - 25% Chance each turn, Automatically at the end of battle
      Enemies - 9.8% Chance each turn


20 - Sleep

Explanation: While asleep, a character cannot do anything, but can receive 
damage and healing. When attacking a sleeping target, the target's evade is
not factored in to chance to hit, and the attacker's Attack rating will be
multiplied by 5/4. A sleeping character is still scheduled for a turn each 
round, and on that turn will either stay "Asleep" or will be "Cured!"

Inflicted By
        Spells: SLEP, SLP2
        Skills: None
        Status Attack: MUMMY, WzMUMMY


Cure: PCs     - Wake if R = 0...80 is less than Max HP,
                Automatically at the end of battle.
      Enemies - Bugged. It is supposed to be the same as PCs, but enemies
                always wake on their first turn.


40 - Silence

Explanation: While silenced, a character cannot use the Magic Command (Spells), 
Equip Command (Enchanted Items), or the Drink Command (Potions). It is arguable
as to whether this is a bug or not, given it doesn't make much conceptual sense
for being silenced to prevent you from drinking a potion unless, as anomie put
it, Mute literally removes your mouth. Whether it should prevent usage of
Enchanted Items is also somewhat unclear, but makes a little more sense. In any
event, all three of these commands are treated as "magic" by in-battle
operations, so that's probably why they're all prohibited. By the same token,
enemies are prevented from using their special attacks, which are also
effectively "Magic."

If a character has a command pending that Silence would ordinarily prevent in
the round they are silenced, the message "Silenced" will appear when their turn
comes up, and no action will be taken. In future rounds, you will be unable to
select one of the prohibited commands. By contrast, enemies will still attempt
to cast spells and waste turns on them after being silenced.

Inflicted By
        Spells: MUTE
        Skills: None
        Status Attack: None

Cure: AMUT, Automatically at the end of battle


80 - Confuse

Explanation: When confused, an enemy will either attack another enemy or itself
on its turn, or recover from confusion. Enemies do not actually "attack" each
other however, but rather, are programmed to cast the "FIRE" spell. This is
true regardless of which enemy it is. PCs cannot be confused.

Inflicted By
        Spells: CONF
        Skills: None
        Status Attack: None

Cure: 25% Chance each turn



E. ENEMY TYPES                                                          [ETYP]

Just like elements and statuses, there are 8 enemy families:

01 - Magical                            10 - Were
02 - Dragon                             20 - Aquatic
04 - Giant                              40 - Mage
08 - Undead                             80 - Regenerative

An enemy may be any combination of these, or none of them. Enemy families are 
relevant for 3 purposes:

1) Weapon Damage/Accuracy Bonuses (bugged and does not work)
2) HARM (only Undead are set to be affected)
3) Setting regenerative status (bugged and does not work)

So in practice, enemy types are largely irrelevant in the bugged NES version 
(aside from Undead for HARM purposes). Nevertheless, here's a breakdown of 
which enemies belong to which family.


01 - Magical (26 Enemies)

WrWOLF, SHADOW, IMAGE, WRAITH, GHOST, PHANTOM, GrMEDUSA, CATMAN, VAMPIRE, 
WzVAMP, GARGOYLE, R.GOYLE, EARTH, FIRE, WATER, AIR, WIZARD, MudGOL, RockGOL, 
IronGOL, EVILMAN, NITEMARE, LICH, LICH 2, KARY, KARY 2

These enemies tend to have a "supernatural" or "magical" feel about them.


02 - Dragon (22 Enemies)

IGUANA, AGAMA, SAURIA, ASP, COBRA, SeaSNAKE, Frost D, Red D, Zombie D, WYVERN,
WYRM, TYRO, T Rex, FrGATOR, HYDRA, R.HYDRA, CHIMERA, JIMERA, Gas D, Blue D,
TIAMAT, TIAMAT 2

These enemies tend to be draconian or reptillian in nature.


04 - Giant (8 Enemies)

IMP, GrIMP, GIANT, FrGIANT, R.GIANT, OGRE, GrOGRE, WzOGRE

This may arguably be better rendered as "humanoid"


08 - Undead (19 Enemies)

BONE, R.BONE, ZomBULL, SHADOW, IMAGE, WRAITH, GHOST, ZOMBIE, GHOUL, GEIST, 
SPECTER, PHANTOM, VAMPIRE, WzVAMP, Zombie D, MUMMY, WzMUMMY, LICH, LICH 2

Incorporates zombies, skeletons, vampires, mummies, ghosts, etc.


10 - Were (2 Enemies)

WrWOLF, CATMAN

That's right, 2 enemies. Easily the most pointless enemy group.


20 - Aquatic (13 Enemies)

SAHAG, R.SAHAG, WzSAHAG, GrSHARK, BigEYE, SeaSNAKE, LOBSTER, SeaTROLL, NAGA, 
WIZARD, KRAKEN, KRAKEN 2

Enemies you would expect to find in the water, including "Wizards" but not
"Sorcerers"


40 - Mage (16 Enemies)

WzOGRE, EYE, MANCAT, WzVAMP, NAGA, GrNAGA, MudGOL, RockGOL, EVILMAN, MAGE, 
FIGHTER, LICH, LICH 2, KARY, KARY 2, TIAMAT, TIAMAT 2

Enemies that use magic spells (plus Tiamat)


80 - Regenerative (9 Enemies)

WrWOLF, WzOGRE, TROLL, SeaTROLL, PHANTOM, CATMAN, VAMPIRE, WzVAMP, WARMECH

Regenerative enemies have an extra feature: they regenerate a portion of their
HP after every round. Or at least they _would_ regenerate HP, if regeneration
weren't bugged. I believe that they were supposed to regenerate 2 HP per round,
as an opposite to Poison. In FF: Origins this was changed to 5% and works.

| III. CHARACTER STATISTICS                                             [SEC3]|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. GAINING STATS                                                        [STGN]

1. Hit Points

HP goes up by VIT/4 per level. On designated level-ups for each class, a
"Strong" HP-up will occur, adding a bonus 20-25 HP on top of that. These are
specified for certain levels for each class and will not occur randomly.


2. SAIVL

Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Vitality, and Luck gains may be guaranteed 
upon level up for a class. When one of these stats increases, it always does so
by 1 point. Each class has preset minimum gains for each stat, with some levels
guaranteed to have an increase in a particular stat(s). For any stat that is
not guaranteed upon level up, there is a 25% chance to gain that stat. So for
example,

Odds for Stat Increase
Level 2 Black Belt      Level 3 Black Belt      Level 4 Black Belt
STR:  25%               STR: 100%               STR:  25%
AGI: 100%               AGI:  25%               AGI: 100%
INT:  25%               INT: 100%               INT:  25%
VIT: 100%               VIT: 100%               VIT: 100%
LCK: 100%               LCK: 100%               LCK:  25%


3. Hit % and Magic Defense

Each of these stats increases linearly at a fixed rate for each class. The 
Magic Defense stat is, however, hidden and cannot be observed in-game.



B. CLASS BREAKDOWN                                                      [CLAS]

Due to a bug, Black Belts gain +4 Magic Defense per level, but Master actually
gain considerably less, +1. It is thus advantageous to hold off on class change
for a Black Belt.

*The L1 Spell charge gain at level 22 comes suspiciously soon and breaks the 
pattern of spell charge gains for the Red Mage. In light of the fact that the 
RM gains a tenth L1 spell charge at level 35, this one in keeping with the 
pattern, and the fact that no other class gets a tenth spell charge for any 
spell level, nor does the Red Mage gain a tenth charge for any other level,
and that spell charges are capped at nine making the tenth charge ineffectual, 
strongly suggests that the gain at L22 was unintentional and qualifies as a
bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. VARIABLES                                                            [PVAR]

A = Attack (Listed in the game as "Damage")
D = Defense (Listed in the game as "Absorb")
H = Hit % (Accuracy)
E = Evasion
BC = Base Chance to Hit


1. The formula for a character's Attack ("Damage") rating is:

Standard
Attack = Weapon Attack + STR/2

Armed BB/MA or BM/BW 
Attack = Weapon Attack + STR/2 + 1

Unarmed BB/MA
Attack = Level*2

NOTE: Attack power cannot be higher than 255. It will "roll over" to 0 and 
continue to climb from there if it goes higher. (This is not possible during 
normal gameplay).


2. The formula for a character's Defense ("Absorb") rating is:

Standard
Defense = Sum of Equipped Armor

Unequipped* BB/MA
Defense = Level

*NOTE: The game is supposed to check to see if the BB is wearing armor, and if
not, to set Defense = Level. However, the game is bugged to check whether a
Weapon is equipped, rather than armor, upon level-up. As a result, if a BB is
unarmed but wearing armor and levels up, the level is used for defense rather
than armor. This can be dangerous later in the game, where a BB is likely to be
using armor but not a weapon. However, it can be fixed simply by entering the 
Armor screen in the menu.

It may be worth noting that at very high levels, this bug can be exploited to
give a BB the benefits of a Ribbon without having to sacrifice the good natural
Defense that comes with a high level.


3. The formula for a character's Hit% is:

Hit% = Weapon Accuracy + Character's Hit%


4. The formula for a character's Evasion is:

Evasion = 48 + AGL - Armor Weight


5. The formula for determining a character's # of Hits is:

Standard
# of Hits = [1+(Hit%/32)]*Hit Multiplier

Unarmed BB/MA
# of Hits = 2([1+(Hit%/32)]*Hit Multiplier)

*Hit Multiplier = 1 by default, and ranges from 0 to 2
*FAST increases Hit Multiplier by 1
*SLOW decreases Hit Multiplier by 1
*Minimum number of hits is 1


6. A Character's Critical Hit Rate is determined by:

Standard
Critical Rate = Weapon Index Number*

Unarmed BB/MA
Critical Rate = Level*2

Unarmed non-BB/MA
Critical Rate = 0

*This is a bug. Critical rates were supposed to use another variable.



B. DAMAGE FORMULAS                                                      [DFRM]

NOTES:
*Calculate Damage separately for each hit
*Minimum Value of Damage for each hit is 1
*Total Damage from an Attack is the sum of all damage from successful hits


1. The formula for Physical Damage is:

Damage = A...2A - D
--If the Target is weak to an Elemental or Enemy-Type attribute of the weapon,
add +4 to A (this is bugged and doesn't work on the NES version)
--If the target is Asleep or Paralyzed, A = A*5/4


2. For Critical Hits, the formula is:

Damage = (A...2A) + (A...2A - D)

NOTE: Both sets of A...2A are the same value


On FF: Origins, the formula for Critical Hits appears to be different.



C) ACCURACY FORMULAS                                                    [AFRM]

1. Base Chance to Hit (BC) 

Base Chance to Hit = 168
--If the Attacker is blind, subtract -40
--If the Target is blind, add +40
--If the Target is weak to an attack, add +40*
*This occurs if a Weapon Attribute matches an Elemental Weakness or Enemy Type
characteristic on the enemy. This property is bugged and does not work on the
NES version.


2. Chance to Hit 

Chance to Hit = (BC + H)* - E
--If the Target is Asleep or Paralyzed, Chance to Hit = BC

*The value in parenthesis is capped at 255 _before_ Evasion is subtracted

A Hit Roll is done and a random number is selected from 0 to 200. If that
number is less than or equal to the Chance to Hit, the Hit connects. 0 is an
automatic hit, and 200 is an automatic miss. The % chance of hitting may be
expressed by:

Percentage Chance to Hit = [Chance to Hit + 1]/201


NOTE: The _proper_ Chance to Hit Formula _should_ be:

BC + H - E
--If the Target is Asleep or Paralyzed, Chance to Hit = BC + H

However, a bug in the NES version clamps Base Chance to Hit and Hit% at 255
before Evasion can be subtracted (and ignores Hit% when asleep or paralyzed).
This means that as a practical matter, Hit% greater than 87 is irrelevant for
Accuracy. This is also what allows a character to become virtually un-hittable
by repeatedly using RUSE or INVS to reach max evasion. I believe this bug is
fixed on Origins.


3. Critical Hit Chance

Standard
Critical Rate = Weapon Index Number

For Unarmed BB/MAs
Critical Rate = Level*2

For Unarmed Non-BB/MA
Critical Rate = 0

If the random number selected for the Hit Roll is less than or equal to the
Critical Rate, then that hit is a Critical Hit. 0 is an automatic Critical, and
200 is an automatic Non-Critical. The % chance of getting a Critical Hit may be
expressed by:

Percentage Chance for Critical = [CRT + 1]/201

NOTES:
*Even with a Critical Rate of 0, there is a default 1/201 chance of a 0 being 
generated, which is an automatic critical hit.
*It is possible (albeit very unlikely) for the Chance to Hit to be LOWER than 
the Critical Rate. If this happens, it is possible for a roll that qualifies as
a Critical Hit to ALSO qualify as a miss, which results in the attack missing
(a "Critical Miss" if you will).



D. STATUS ATTACKS                                                       [SFRM]

This represents an enemy's chance to inflict status ailments with a Physical
Attack.


1. Base Chance to Inflict

Base Chance = 100
--If the Target is resistant to an enemy's Weakness*, Base Chance = 0

*This is a bug. It should use the Enemy's Attack Element instead of its 
weakness. I believe this is fixed in Origins.


2. Chance to Inflict

Chance to Inflict = BC - MD

Select a random number from 0...200. If the number is equal to or less than the
Chance to Inflict, the status is applied. This is calculated separately for
each hit.

NOTE: This is bugged on the NES so that (most) misses following a successful
hit get a chance to inflict the status as well. Misses because of rolling a 200
do not get a chance to inflict the status however. anomie has come up with the
following to illustrate this:

H = Hit
M = Normal Miss
X = Miss from rolling 200
* = Chance to inflict status

M M H* M* M* X M* H* X

This _should_ be:

M M H* M M X M H* X

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spells, Enemy Skills, Spells used through Enchanted Items, and Items used 
through the Drink command all operate as "Magic."


A. VARIABLES                                                            [MVAR]

E = Effectivity. Determined by Spell. (Effectively capped at 255)
SA = Spell Accuracy. Determined by Spell.
MD = Magic Defense. Determined by Target.
BC = Base Chance to Hit = 148



B. HEALING AND DAMAGE                                                   [HEDA]

1) Healing Magic

HP Recovered = E...2E (max 255)

CUR4 does not use this formula, but rather, sets HP to max and clears 
negative status.

Note that out-of-battle, healing magic does not use these formulas. Rather,
each spell is programmed to restore a set amount of HP, plus a variable
range. These values are listing in F(1) below.


2) Attack Magic

Resisted Attack Spell
Damage = E...2E

Unresisted Attack Spell
Damage = 2(E...2E)

--If target is resistant to spell element, divide effectivity by 2
--If the target is weak to spell element, multiply effectivity by 1.5

To determine whether a spell is resisted, look to whether the hit roll 
(described in B below) succeeds. If it does, the E...2E value is doubled. If
it does not, the value remains E...2E.


C. CHANCE TO HIT (DOUBLE)                                               [MHIT]

NOTE: Status spells can hit or miss, which is determined by this calculation.
Damaging spells always "hit," but may be "resisted," in which case the doubling
component of the damage calculation does not occur, and the spell does only
half of its potential damage.

1) Base Chance to Hit = 148
--If the target is Resistant to the spell's element, set BC to 0
--If the target is Weak to the spell's element, add +40 to BC

NOTE: If a target is both Resistant and Weak, the base chance is set to 0, but
40 is still added, resulting in BC = 40.


2) Chance to Hit = BC + SA - MD

A Hit Roll is done where a random number is selected from 0...200. If the 
number is equal or less than the Chance to Hit, the spell hits (or doubles). A
0 is always a successful hit, and a 200 is always a miss.


3) Exceptions

*Positive Effects (Effect Routines 07, 08, 09, 0A, OB, OC, OD, OF, 10)
 automatically hit.
*If an enemy is weak to XFER's element, set BC to 188 rather than adding +40.
 This is immaterial however as XFER has no element.
*300HP Threshold Spells (STUN, BLND, and XXXX) always hit if the target is not
 resistant and its current HP is equal to or less than 300, and always miss
 otherwise.



D. EFFECT ROUTINES (thanks to anomie)                                  [EFFC]

Magic operates depending upon which effect routine is assigned. An explanation
of the routines the game uses follows below:

00 - Nothing
01 - Damage - This is used for Attack Magic
02 - Undead Damage - This is identical to 01, but only hits Undead
03 - Status Ailment - Inflicts status ailment(s) indicated by bitmask in 
     Effectivity
04 - Hit Multiplier Down - Subtracts 1 from target's Hit Multiplier
05 - Morale Down - Subtracts Effectivity from the target's Morale
06 - [Unused] - Points to HP Recovery Routine
07 - HP Recovery - Increases target's HP by E...2E, max 255
08 - Restore Status - Undoes status ailment(s) indicated by bitmask in 
     Effectivity. (All actions are "ineffective" against Dead or Petrified 
     targets, so this effect cannot cure them) 
09 - Defense Up* - Adds Effectivity to target's Defense
0A - Resist Element* - Grants Elemental Resistance
0B - Attack Up** - Adds Effectivity to Attack 
0C - Hit Multiplier Up - Adds 1 to target's Hit Multiplier
0D - Attack/Accuracy Up** - Adds Effectivity to Attack, and Spell Accuracy to
     Hit%
0E - Evasion Down - Subtracts Effectivity from Evade. Bugged to always miss.
0F - Full HP/Status Recovery - Restores HP to Max and clears negative status.
10 - Evasion Up - Adds Effectivity to Evade.
11 - Remove Resistance* - Clears Elemental Resistance
12 - 300HP Status - Set status to bitmask in Effectivity if not resistant and
     HP is 300 or less.

*Effect Routine is bugged and spells that use it will not work on enemies.
 (Effect 0A misses Enemy Caster, but may hit other enemies)
**Effect Routine is bugged and spells that use it will not work on PCs.



E. MAGIC BATTLE DATA                                                   [MBDT]

Effectivity - Spell Effectivity value. Deca value is used when Effectivity is 
used to calculate something (or unused), but the symbolic representation of the
bitmask is identified for Statuses and Elements.

-S- = Single Target     S-A = Single Ally       S-E = Single Enemy
-A- = All Targets       A-A = All Allies        A-E = All Enemies
-C- = Caster

BUGS
*TMPR should use OB (Attack Up) rather than 0D (Attack/Accuracy Up)
*LOK2 should use 0E (Evasion Down) rather than 10 (Evasion Up)
*HEL2 should have 24 Effectivity, rather than 48
*SABR should have a spell accuracy value; what value is uncertain.
**From a Player standpoint, LOCK, TMPR, SABR, and XFER do not work, and LOK2 
actually helps the enemy.

before. This can be circumvented by utilizing a Tent afterwards and saving
again.

A. ENCOUNTERS                                                           [ENCT]

NOTE: FF: Origins utilizes a different Random Number Generator than the NES. As
such, the following will probably not apply to that version of the game.


1. Encounter Frequency (thanks to silktail and sqpat)

[This section is flagged for further investigation and potential rewrite]

A random number R is generated that determines the amount of steps before the 
next battle is initiated. This number decreases with each step on a tile set 
for random encounters, and when it reaches 0, a battle is initiated. At this 
point, another number is generated to determine the number of steps before the 
next battle. This number is only reset once it has reached 0, or when the game 
is reset or powered on. Otherwise, it is merely suspended if an area where 
random battles are not possible is entered.

This random number, however, like many "random" things in this game, is not
really random. There is a preset table of values that are drawn in sequence as
the value for R, that vary depending on whether the number is generated on the
Overworld, on the Ocean, or in a Dungeon. The following is a list that sets
out the sequence of values for each area. The starting point of each list is
dependent on whether the game is played on an NES or an Emulator (because of
differences in how each calculates the random numbers). For an Emulator, begin
at the first value and go from there. For the NES, begin at 41 for the
Overworld (I am uncertain as to the starting points for Dungeons, though there
is no difference for Ocean battles).

Finally, the first number generated after powering on the game is 15 less than
it normally is. So, whichever number you start at in the list, subtract 15
steps from. If you make it all the way through the list, though, do not
subtract 15 the second time around.

2. Random Encounter List (thanks to Rincewind and sqpat)

Each domain map has eight different Enemy Formations. A "random" number is
generated to determine which one of these battles is chosen when a random
battle is initiated. In reality, this "random" number is drawn from a table of
256 numbers, with values ranging from 1 to 8, corresponding to the eight random
encounters available in each domain map. The occurrence of these numbers is: 

1: 48/256               5: 24/256
2: 48/256               6: 24/256
3: 48/256               7: 12/256
4: 48/256               8:  4/256

However, these numbers are not proportionally distributed across all 256
numbers (for example, the first "8" appears on the 129th battle after power-on,
making it much rarer in practice than a "1/64" chance would tend to imply).

This list resets after Power-Off, but _not_ after Resetting. This is what makes
the infamous Kyzoku trick possible (at least on the NES - it may not work on
some emulators). The first number in the encounter list is a "3". A Formation
of up to 5 Kyzokus (which are known for high Gold rewards early in the game for
relatively low difficulty) happens to be the 3rd Encounter in the Ocean Domain.
The trick involves Powering On, going to sea, fighting Kyzokus, going back to
town, saving, powering off, and then powering on again, rinse and repeat.

NOTE: Sometimes different cartridges or NES consoles or emulators will produce
different starting points. This may have to do with how the memory (SRAM?) is
initialized when the game is started.

3. "Spiked" Squares

Some tiles are "spiked" to have an automatically trigger a pre-programmed 
encounter. This encounter is not limited to the 8 Formations listed in the 
domain data, and is always the same. A spiked square always remains spiked, and
the battle on it can be triggered each time it is stepped on, ad infinitum. 
This does not affect the counter for the next random battle.


4. Sprite-Initiated Encounters

There are some encounters that are initiated by conversing with a character 
sprite (specifically, Garland, Bikke, Astos, the Vampire, each of the Fiends 
(first iteration), and Garland again). These are only available once, and 
cannot be fought again. They do not affect the counter for the next random 
battle.


5. Damage Tiles

Lava and Ice tiles inflict 1HP Damage/Step, but will not drop a character below
1HP. They do not have random encounters enabled, and the Step Counter is
suspended while walking over them. Interestingly, they will still drain HP from
Petrified characters.



B. AMBUSH/PREEMPTIVE (Thanks to Paulygon)                               [AMBU]

1) Variables

V = Ambush/Preemptive Chance (if V < 0, V = 0)
I = Initiative (Leader's Agility + Luck)/8
S = Surprise Factor
R = Random number from I...100


2) Ambush/Preemptive Chance

V = R + I - S

Ambush: V <= 10
Normal: 10 < V < 90
Preemptive: V >= 90

If the Ambush/Preemptive Chance is 10 or less, the encounter is an Ambush. If
the value is greater than 10 but less than 90, then the encounter is Normal.
Finally, if the value is 90 or greater, the encounter is a Preemptive Attack.

NOTES:
*Non-Runnable Battles can only be Normal
*Surprise Factor depends on enemy groups.

C. TURN ORDER (thanks to anomie and Paulygon)                           [TURN]

Every PC and every enemy is scheduled for a turn, whether they are dead or
alive, and whether they are present or not (in the case of enemies, where all
nine slots are scheduled even if there are fewer than nine enemies). Any
character that is dead, petrified, or doesn't exist is simply skipped when its
turn comes up.

Scheduling is done by starting with:

00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 80 81 82 83

00-08 Represent Enemies
80-83 Represent PCs

Pick two random numbers 0...12 and swap the numbers at those two positions. Do
this 17 times. The resulting sequence is the order in which characters and
enemies act. You may notice that this process is advantageous to enemies and
disadvantageous to PCs, so perceptions that PCs act later disproportionately
would probably be correct.



D. RUNNING                                                              [RUN ]

1. PCs

Running is always successful in a preemptive attack, and never possible in 
unrunnable battles. Running is successful if:

Luck > 0...[Level + 15]

However, running is bugged on the NES and it loads something else instead of 
the runner's level:

Slot 1: Slot 3's Status byte
Slot 2: Slot 4's Status byte
Slot 3: Identifier for entity that attacks third, either 0-8 or 128-131 
Slot 4: Depending on the one's digit of Slot 4's HP, 128-137

So, someone in Slot 1 or 2 will usually be able to run if their Luck is 15 or 
higher and the character in slot 3 or 4 has normal status.

Running was supposed to have been fixed on the Origins version, but it
succeeds much less frequently than one would expect given the formula above,
and without apparent regard for luck. It appears that running is bugged in a
different, unknown way on Origins.


2. Enemies

Enemies can always run in any battle. They will if:

Morale - 2*[Leader's Level] + (0...50) < 80



E. PARTY REORDERING (thanks to anomie)                                  [ORDR]

When a character is dead, petrified, or poisoned at the conclusion of a battle,
party order is automatically adjusted. The intent is to move characters that
have these statuses to the back of the party line, giving priority in the
following order: Poisoned > Petrified > Dead. So, if character A is poisoned,
character B is dead, character C is normal, and character D is petrified, the
party order would normally be:

C
A
D
B

HOWEVER, sorting is bugged. The following is a directly copied explanation from
anomie:

"The background: after a battle, the game re-sorts your warriors based on their
status ailments. It does this by "tagging" each warrior with a number made up
of the warrior's current slot (0-3) plus a number based on the status (dead=64,
stone=32, poison=16, normal=0). Then it performs a simple bubble sort. It's
supposed to end up with the afflicted warriors moved to the end, but otherwise
maintain the original order. But in 106 of the 256 possible combinations of
statuses, it gets the order screwed up.

The cause of the bug is that the "swap" function is passed the original slot
numbers rather than the current slot numbers. So for example, if the numbers
start out as "00 41 12 03" (i.e. second warrior dead, third poisoned), the
bubble sort will proceed as follows:
 
00 41 12 03 ; Compare 00 and 41: no swap 
00 41 12 03 ; Compare 41 and 12: Swap slots 1 and 2 
00 12 41 03 ; Compare 41 and 03: Swap slots 1 and 3 (instead of 2 and 3) 
00 03 41 12 ; Compare 00 and 03: no swap 
00 03 41 12 ; Compare 03 and 41: no swap 
00 03 41 12 ; Compare 41 and 12: Swap slots 1 and 2 (instead of 2 and 3) 
00 41 03 12 ; Compare 00 and 41: no swap 
00 41 03 12 ; Compare 41 and 03: Swap slots 1 and 3 (instead of 1 and 2) 
00 12 03 41 ; Compare 03 and 41: no swap 
00 12 03 41 ; Compare 00 and 12: no swap 
00 12 03 41 ; Compare 12 and 03: Swap slots 2 and 3 (instead of 1 and 2) 
00 12 41 03 ; Compare 41 and 03: Swap slots 1 and 3 (instead of 2 and 3)

A. ENEMY BEHAVIOR                                                       [BEHA]

1. Choosing an Action

All enemies may use a basic attack, and will always do so unless another action
takes priority. Depending on whether the enemy has AI set, it may also use 
Spells and/or Enemy Skills. Finally, enemies may run (any enemy may run from 
any battle). This has the highest priority. So the four actions an enemy may 
take, and the order of priority amongst them, are:

1. Run
2. Spell
3. Skill
4. Attack

    1. First, an enemy determines whether or not to run. An enemy will run if:

       Morale - 2*[Leader's Level] + (0...50) < 80

    2. Assuming the enemy determines not to run, it then checks for AI. If
       there is none, it proceeds directly to a regular attack. If it finds AI,
       it moves on to check for Spell AI first.

       If there is Spell AI, it chooses a random number from 0...128. If that 
       number is equal to or less than the spell chance number for that enemy, 
       it casts a Spell. If not, it then proceeds to check for Skill AI.

    3. If an enemy has not run and has not cast a spell, it checks for Skill 
       AI. If there is Skill AI, it chooses a random number from 0...128. If 
       that number is equal to or less than the skill chance number for that 
       enemy, the enemy uses a Skill. If not, it Attacks.

    4. If the enemy does not run, use a spell, or a skill, it will attack.

If an enemy decides to use a Spell or a Skill, it chooses the next one in its 
spell list. An enemy may have up to 8 Spells and up to 4 Skills. These lists 
are separate and independent. It always begins with the first spell or skill in
its list, and then moves on sequentially. This order never varies. If it 
reaches the end of the list, it starts over from the beginning. Enemies have no
SP, and there is no limit to the number of Spells or Skills an enemy can use in
a given battle.


2. Targeting (Thanks to Ben Siron)

If an enemy's action is single-target in nature (regular attack or appropriate
Spell/Skill), the enemy generates a random number, R = 1...8. This number
determines that enemy's target:

Slot 1: 1-4 (50% Chance)
Slot 2: 5-6 (25% Chance)
Slot 3: 7 (12.5% Chance)
Slot 4: 8 (12.5% Chance)

If the target chosen is Dead or Petrified, it generates a new random number 
until a valid target is selected.



B. ENEMY DATA                                                           [EDAT]

000 NAME (ORIGINS NAME)	[TRANSLATED JAPANESE NAME, IF DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINS]

HP: Hit Points          SATK: Status Attack     GOLD: Gold
ATK: Attack             ELEM: S. Attack Element EXP.: Experience
ACC: Accuracy (#Hits)*  TYPE: Enemy Family
CRT: Critical Rate      WEAK: Weakness(es)      FORM: Formations
DEF: Defense            RESI: Resistances       LCTN: Locations

M.D: Magic Defense      MAGIC:   X/128 - SPELLS
MOR: Morale             SPECIAL: X/128 - SKILLS

*Number of hits is displayed next to accuracy simply because it is a convenient
place to do so. Number of hits are NOT linked to Hit% with enemies as they are
with PCs; they are two completely different stats.

NOTES:

*Gold from each enemy defeated is added together, and given to the party
collectively in the amount shown.
*Experience from each enemy defeated is added together, and divided evenly by
the number of living, non-petrified PCs at the end of the battle (usually by 4,
assuming no one is petrified or dead). Minimum experience from any battle is 1,
even if all enemies run away.

*Status Attack Element is not used. Instead, the enemy's weakness is used in 
its place.

*Many sources refer to enemy "Strength" and "Agility." However, this 
terminology can be confusing because enemies do not have "Strength" or 
"Agility" in the same way that PCs do. The stats that enemies possess are 
analogous to the derived stats of "Attack" (or "Damage" in-game) and "Evasion."
This is an important distinction, because if their stats were really "Strength"
and "Agility," that would imply dividing by 2 to get Attack and adding 48 to
get Evasion, which is not the case.

*R.Goyles have something of a quirk, because they are the only enemy with an
attack element, but no status inflicted on-strike. It is unclear whether the
attack element was erroneously added, or whether the status attack was omitted
(based on element, it would probably have been Poison or Petrify, or less
likely, Death).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. FORMATION DYNAMICS                                                   [FORM]

There are 256 enemy groups. These can be subdivided into 128 core groups with
2 formations each. Most, but not all, are used in the game. Each group uses a
particular pattern table for enemy graphics which, in practice, restricts the
enemies that may appear together. For example, one pattern table contains the
sprites for Imp enemies, Wolf enemies, Lizard enemies, and Giant enemies. This
is why you may see Imps, Wolves, Lizards, and/or Giants in the same battle.
However, for this very same reason, you will never see an Imp in the same
battle as a Spider, and you will never see Wyvern fighting alongside a Zombie.
While there is no restriction on which enemy data is capable of being present
in a given formation, the restriction on appearance serves as a practical
restriction on which enemies can appear together. These pattern tables are:

Pattern Tables

00 Imp, Wolf, Iguana, Giant
01 Bone, Creep, Hyena, Ogre
02 Ghost, Zombie, Worm, Eye
03 Slime, Spider, Manticore, Ankylo
04 Badman, Astos, Madpony, WarMech
05 Snake, Scorpion, Bull, Troll
06 Vampire, Gargoyle, Element 1, Dragon 1
07 Mummy, Cockatrice, Wyvern, Tyro
08 Medusa, Catman, Pede, Tiger
09 Wizard, Garland, Dragon 2, Golem
0A Caribe, Gator, Ocho, Hydra
0B Sentry, Element 2, Naga, Chimera
0C Sahag, Pirate, Shark, BigEye
0D Lich, Kary
0E Kraken, Tiamat
0F Chaos

Most pattern tables contain 2 small enemies, and 2 large enemies. These are 
capable of three formation types:

(Up to) 9 Small Enemies
(Up to) 4 Large Enemies
(Up to) 2 Large Enemies and 6 Small Enemies

Two pattern tables contain 2 fiends each, and one pattern table is devoted 
entirely to Chaos. Each of these can only display one enemy sprite at a time.

C. ENEMY DOMAIN MAPPING                                                 [EMAP]

1. Overworld (Thanks to Ben Siron for design inspiration)

The World Map is a 256x256 unit grid. Mapping this grid, we have the following 
coordinates:

Northwestern Corner: (  0,  0)
Northeastern Corner: (255,  0)
Southwestern Corner: (  0,255)
Southeastern Corner: (255,255)

The World Map is further subdivided into an 8x8 grid of 64 domain areas of 
32x32 tiles each. Each of these domains has its own random encounter data. 
Oceans and Rivers (North and South) each form an overlay. The data for these 
overlays is stored in Coneria (Northern Rivers), Pravoka (Southern Rivers),
and Elfland (Oceans). The main World Map chart controls for land-encounters,
and the overlays operate for Ocean and River tiles. The following is a 
representation of the Overworld Map and the Ocean and River overlays:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This should be just about every bug in the game. If you know of any bugs you 
don't see here, please contact me. For fixes to nearly all of these bugs, see 
the Bug Fixes and Enhancements thread over on the boards:

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=522595&topic=45575058

 
*The Ribbon's name has an extra space 
*The Airship can land on the caravan. 
*There are two Canoe items. One shows up in the menu but doesn't do anything,
 and the other works, but doesn't show up in the menu. 
*House saves before restoring MP. Also needs message corrected. 
*BB Armor bug, it looks at whether a weapon is equipped instead of checking
 armor. 
*The game never actually calculates Damage Rating from STR, it just
 adds/subtracts weapon damage as you equip/unequip things. For the BB/MA, it
 does recalculated Damage based on STR when the BB/MA has a weapon equipped,
 but rounds *up* instead of *down* when adding STR/2 to the Weapon's Damage. 
*BB Magic Defense Growth is +4, while MA Magic Defense Growth is +1. Several
 other values are suspect and there is evidence others may be bugged. 
*The RM/RW gains a tenth L1 spell charge at Level 35. The bug is probably an
 erroneous gained L1 spell charge at Level 22.
*The "swap" function used when character order is rearranged after battle is
 passed the original slot numbers rather than the current slot numbers, causing
 incorrect ordering in 106 of the 256 possible combinations of statuses.
*A phantom door will appear if you exit the menu while standing in a doorway
 and then walk down. 
*NPCs can walk through you under certain circumstances. 
*The data from the last enemy domain area you were in is used when you get into
 a battle (on the Overworld?).  
*The Peninsula North East of Pravoka (PNEOP) is the result of overworld
 mapping, whereby the monsters from the zone primarily overlaying the area
 around Lufein overlaps on a few tiles. There isn't really any fix other than
 remapping the terrain.
*Target-dark should not be applied when the target is asleep/stopped. 
*Hit% should be applied even if asleep, and not clamped until after evade is
 subtracted.
*Weapon category/element attack values are never loaded.
*Weapon index is used for critical value.
*Enemies use their category/element as a category/element attack, and the
 warrior's category/element attack as the category/element to attack.
*The player class is used as the creature type when magic is cast. Fortunately,
 only HARM uses it and no class has bit 4 set.
*Weapon elemental attack is used as elemental weakness when magic is cast.
*Running looks in the in-battle data instead of the permanent data.
*MUTE status prevents Item and Drink as well. This is likely a bug, as
 preventing drink makes no real sense. Whether it should also prevent Item
 usage is uncertain.
*If you gain enough experience in one battle for one of your characters to gain
 2 or more levels, you only gain one level at a time even if you get enough exp
 for 8 levels, and your "For Level Up" value is all wrong until you manage to
 gain levels up to your exp.
*Status attacks are attempted on misses after the first successful hit
*Enemies always wake from sleep.
*Enemy-cast all-allies spells (e.g. AFIR) don't hit the caster.
*Poison doesn't work on enemies.
*In the 2-large-6-small enemy formation the third enemy type will use the
 palette set for the second enemy type rather than the palette set for itself.
*If an enemy kills itself (because it was Confused), the battle won't actually
 end until either one of your warriors tries to attack or cast magic on an
 enemy or the round of battle ends.
*INT is never used.
*HEL2 effectivity should be 0x18.
*LOK2 should use effect 0E instead of 10.
*LOCK (and fixed LOK2) always misses.
*TMPR should probably be using effect 0B instead of 0D.
*For PC targets, Damage and Hit% are never loaded/saved for use by magic. Thus,
 TMPR and SABR are bugged.
*Absorb for enemy targets is loaded from ROM instead of RAM for magic, making
 FOG not work.
*For enemy targets, Hit% is never loaded/saved for use by magic.
*Enemy elemental resistance is not stored in the in-RAM data, so spells like
 AFIR and XFER don't work.
*Several caster bytes are loaded for magic, with wrong values. But none are
 actually used.
*Spells causing multiple status ailments will claim "Ineffective" if the target
 has any of the ailments (all will still be applied though).
*There is an invisible lady in Coneria Castle. Her sprite is set to be visible
 inside rooms, when it should be set to visible outside rooms.
*There is a Bat in the Waterfall that starts on a wall, leading it move into
 the wall area half of the time.
*There is a Fairy sprite in the black area of the Ice Cave (though this is not
 noticeable during normal gameplay).
*The old man next to the submarine in Onrac uses "Wind Orb Lit" as a condition
 for changing dialogue when it should probably be "Water Orb Lit"
*The Sage at 3:00 in the Circle of Sages in Crescent Lake is supposed to use
 Text 9D, but lacks a condition. This should probably be "All Orbs Lit"
*The routine that looks at the tile data and determines whether to use the
 second byte as a message index or not says "not" for far too many values. The
 effect is that you can talk to the Earth and Water Altars, but not the Fire
 and Wind. 
*The Gaia Spring Tile is unused.
*There is an unused Warp Tile in the ToFR Tileset that looks like the Time Warp
 in the ToF Tileset. Its absence may or may not be a bug.
 
This works out to somewhere around ~50, more or less, depending on how you 
interpret some of these. That's a lot of bugs!

| X. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                                         [FAQS]|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, I try to tackle questions that frequently come up about this
game. Not all of these are related to mechanics, but I figured it wouldn't hurt
to include them since they really come up a lot.


Q: Why are there so many bugs in this game? 
A: Who knows? Probably because it was a last-ditch effort, Nasir Gabrelli was
probably very stressed trying to put it all together quickly, and time for
play-testing was likely limited. Most likely, they shipped it off as soon as it
was deemed playable. And in a sense, who can blame them? Now, why they didn't
bother to fix any of these bugs in the three years between its release in Japan
in 1987 and North America in 1990 is another issue entirely (especially since
they did more than just translate the text before releasing it).


Q: What bugs does Final Fantasy: Origins fix?
A: The vast majority of them. The only ones I know for certain that it does not
fix are the Intelligence Bug and the Critical Hit Bug - which happen to be the
two most game-changing bugs in the game. I'm not sure whether Origins changes
Magic Defense Growth values, to the extent those are (probably) bugged. Running
is "fixed", but it appears to have introduced a new bug because it doesn't work
as expected. There may be others not fixed, but I'm not aware of them. I can
say that they "fixed" the Invisible Lady by removing her rather than make her
visible, but interestingly, seemed to give some of her dialogue to a generic
female sprite in the castle that previously didn't say anything unique.


Q: I thought that Critical hits bypassed evasion?
A: A common misconception is that Critical Hits bypass evasion. This likely 
came about because with maximum evasion, the only way a hit can get through is
if a 0 is rolled - which, as explained above, is an automatic critical hit.
Seeing only critical hits connect, combined with the naturally low critical
rate of most enemies (so that the amount of critical hits that got through
roughly matches the general prevalence of critical hits), is probably what led
to the misperception that critical hits ignore evasion.


Q: Is there a damage cap?
A: Interestingly, at least on the original NES version, there isn't really a 
damage cap - or at least not much of one. Damage doesn't cap at 9999 like most 
Final Fantasies; it keeps on going and successfully registers on enemies. Not 
only that, it actually displays properly, too! Things get a little weird when 
you get around ~65000, though. I suspect that it has to do with the hex number 
of 65535 limiting how high the figure can go. Of course, being as that's over 
32 times Chaos' HP and impossible to obtain without changing some of the game's
formulas, this cap has no practical significance.


Q: What is the highest possible damage in this game?
A: If you're talking about the bugged NES version, that would be 8000. Only a 
FASTed level 50 Black Belt/Master is capable of doing this, though. It requires
20 Hits on a 0 Defense enemy, with each hit going critical, and each hit
hitting the top of the potential damage range. Of course, the highest amount of
HP an enemy has is 2000 anyway, so this is 4 times what could ever possibly be
needed.

However, in a patched NES version or in FF: Origins, where Temper and Saber
work, this changes. Attack power can go up to 255 in-battle, allowing for
255...510 damage per hit to a 0 defense enemy. With a L50 Master, that's 10
hits for up to 5100 damage. Double that to 20 hits, and you could reach 10200.
Factor in potential for crits, and that's up to 20400 on a patched NES version
(Origins nerfs crits, so that version would not produce the same result).


Q: What's the lowest possible level you can beat the game on?
A: Theoretically? Level 8, with 4 White Mages. It involves using Fear to make
Kary run from you to avoid the experience from that fight. Of course, actually
accomplishing a L8 victory with 4 White Mages relies on unrealistic luck.

For a more realistic approach, try a party comprised of multiple Fighters. The
lowest possible level without avoiding Kary's experience is L9. Even that is
very difficult to accomplish, but being able to use multiple copies of the
game's best class makes it at least somewhat realistic.

Vcimdarf points out that it is possible to beat the game at lower levels -
levels 4-5 - if you split your experience unevenly. This is true, although
will necessarily involve at least one of the four characters being a higher
level than L8.


Q: What is the Kyzoku trick?
A: The Kyzoku trick is a way of exploiting the game's RNG. Every time the game
is powered on, the first number to determine which random battle in a domain
map is generated will always be the same. In Oceans, this corresponds to a
group of 1 to 5 Kyzokus, which are relatively easy enemies that have very high
Gold rewards for early in the game. The trick involves powering on the game,
getting into an ocean battle, beating the Kyzoku's, going back to town, saving,
powering off, powering on again, rinse and repeat.


Q: Why does the Thief suck so much?
A: A complicated question, but let's give it a shot. For one, the bugs in the
game tend to disadvantage Thief considerably (as they do the White and Black
Mages). Running is bugged, making all those stat points the Thief has sunk into
Luck essentially pointless. Thief's nearly guaranteed escape chance is ruined
thanks to the bug, and it doesn't really run much better than any other class
past level 10ish, so it loses that niche role.

The critical hit bug also hits the Ninja fairly hard. Granted, this doesn't
make the Thief any better, but it does make the Ninja less mediocre from a
relativistic standpoint. Critical hit rates were supposed to be fairly low,
with two glaring exceptions - the Vorpal and the Katana, both with a crit rate
of 30. The latter has better Attack and Hit% than the former, and happens to be
a Ninja-exclusive. However, thanks to the bug, the Katana is hardly special.
While it actually receives a boost from the bug (38 vs. 30), every other weapon
receives a substantially bigger boost. So instead of having a crit rate of 5,
the Knight's ultimate weapon, the Excalibur, has a crit rate of 39. That's just
one example. So the Ninja loses a second niche role, that of crit machine.

But even if these bugs were fixed, it wouldn't be enough to save the Thief/
Ninja and make it truly competitive with other classes. This really comes down
to a matter of balance, and the fact that the original designers did a lousy
job at balancing the classes. The Fighter/Knight class is leagues beyond the
rest, and a Ninja would be hard-pressed to even keep up with a Fighter, let
alone a Knight. (In practice, even if crit rates were what they should have
been, a Knight using the Vorpal would be better than a Ninja using the Katana,
in both Attack Power and Number of Hits). A Thief trying to keep pace with a
Fighter is just a joke. In order for the Thief to stand out in any way, it
would have needed a boost of some sort (I'd favor +3 Hit% per level rather than
+2) and the Fighter would need several nerfs of some sort (among them +2 Hit%
rather than +3). But I'm getting into territory better dealt with elsewhere.


Q: What weapon should I use for a solo Thief challenge?
A: Conventional Wisdom holds that the Dragon Sword or the Coral Sword are the 
best. Those a bit more knowledgeable might clarify that the Coral Sword is a 
better choice, as it has a somewhat higher critical rate. However, the Rune
Sword is another viable option. Technically, the Coral Sword and Dragon Sword
each have 1 more point of Attack than the Rune Sword. True, every point counts
in a solo Thief, but where the Rune Sword shines is in its critical rate.
The entire solo Thief quest is about crits - this is how you bypass boss
defense and actually beat them (barring using Enchanted Items). To this end,
each point of crit rate is even more important than each point of attack,
because getting a crit is the difference between doing 1 damage, or nearly 100.
The Rune Sword trades 1 point of attack for 2 points of crit rate. In my
estimation, this trade is more than worth it.

Of course, if you're playing on Origins, this continues to hold true -
especially since Weapon Elemental/Type attributes are fixed, and the Runeblade
is effective against more enemies than any other weapon except Excalibur -
including Lich, Marilith, and Tiamat. But on Origins, since you have an
unlimited item pool, you'd might as well keep all Thief-usable special swords
and swap them around based on the situation.

For Astos, that same Wisdom holds that the Scimtar is the way to go, because it
gets you to 3 hits faster, which makes beating Astos easier. However, if you
look at the Critical Tables, the Sabre provides a comparable critical chance at
2 hits that the Scimtar provides at 3 hits. As discussed, crit rate is (almost)
everything. I've never done a solo Thief, but I suspect that using the Saber in
the lower 20s might provide comparable odds to using the Scimtar at L26+.


Q: Is the White Mage female?
A: Depends. Do you want to think of her as female? Do you prefer to think of
him as male? Or do you prefer an androgynous conception, or just not knowing?

Realistically speaking, White Mage was probably intended to be male, along with
the other Light Warriors. Male characters were more common than female
characters in early console RPGs, particularly when they were tabula rasa
characters like in FF1 or FF3. Look at it this way: the White Mage sprite in
FFIII looks more feminine than the White Mage sprite in FF1, and all the Onion
Kids in FFIII were originally boys. Add in the White Wizard sprite for more
context, and the case for female weakens further.

And really, what's the basis for people tending to think that the White Mage is
female anyway? The sprite looks a little more androgynous than the others, but
not really feminine. Conscious or subconscious, I think it tends to come from a
stereotype of Healer = female. But while a common stereotype, it doesn't always
bear out. After all, the first FF White Mage archetype character was Ming Wu in
FFII.

But when it comes down to it... does it really matter? These characters have no
defined personalities, they have no back stories - they are whoever you want
them to be. Later versions of this game feature other classes with more
androgynous sprites and an auto-naming system that includes both male and
female names for most classes. So the "it's up to the player" element is not to
be underestimated.


Q: Why don't Wizards or Sorcerers use any magic?
A: Because those aren't their real names. "Wizards" are really "Piscodemons"
and "Sorcerers" are really "Mindflayers," based on Illithids, a tentacled
psychic species in Dungeons and Dragons. While it's possible that something
like "Pisco_demon_" may have been the result of censorship, the more likely
reason is that their names were changed to avoid potential copyright issues.


Q: What other Dungeons and Dragons references are there in this game?
A: A lot. Like, the entire game is loosely based on it, including several of
the mechanics. Never having played D&D, I couldn't point out all of them, but
many of the enemies were based on D&D enemies - one of which, the Beholder, was
given an entirely redesigned sprite and renamed "Eye" for the North American
release.


Q: Why are you using NES terminology?
A: Because this is based on the NES version? Truth be told, I much prefer the
retranslations (lots of elements of the NES translation rub me the wrong way...
for one, all the CAPS get annoying). I'm considering making an Origins-specific
version of this document where all of the terminology is replaced, the bugged
mechanics are made to reflect the way they should (and to my knowledge do)
work, and the stats reflect those that were changed.


Q: Will you make a version of this for the GBA/PSP remake?
A: Probably not. No one has bothered to really dissect that version as
thoroughly as people have here, and I've spent much less time learning about
what is known about those versions. My ability to properly reflect all the
changes (or rather, lack thereof) wouldn't warrant making another version of

This is a list of my source for the information in this FAQ, at least when it
could be determined. Some information others may recognize as being available
elsewhere, but if it is commonly available and I did not credit it, odds are I
duplicated the work with my own individual research to avoid reproducing
potential errors. (Of course, if you see I have made errors myself, please let
me know; this is a very large document, and a few are bound to pop up!).
